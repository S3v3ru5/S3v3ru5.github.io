description: Security audits and contest participation

I'm S3v3ru5 (inspired by Severus from Harry Potter), a blockchain security researcher specializing in smart contract auditing across Ethereum, Solana, and Algorand. My security journey began with CTF competitions (2019-2021) focused on cryptography, before transitioning to blockchain security in late 2021.

I worked as a Blockchain Security Engineer at Trail of Bits (June 2022 - June 2024), where I became the primary auditor for Solana protocols and Rust-based blockchain infrastructure, including compilers and VM implementations. During this time, I also involved in development of Tealer, a static analyzer for Algorand smart contracts, and contributed to solana-lints for detecting vulnerabilities in Solana programs.

Currently, I work as an independent security researcher, conducting audits through SpearBit and partnering with firms like Certora, Sherlock and OffBeat Security. I've audited protocols spanning DeFi (lending, AMMs, yield aggregators), bridges, liquid staking, and infrastructure projects across Ethereum, Solana, and Algorand. I also actively participate in security contests on Sherlock and CodeHawks, achieving top-5 placements in multiple competitions including 2nd place in WooFi Swap Solana and 3rd place in Orderly Solana Vault.
